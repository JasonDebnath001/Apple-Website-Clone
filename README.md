# 🚀 Apple MacBook Pro Landing Page Clone 🚀

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my recreation of the stunning Apple MacBook Pro landing page. I've always been a huge admirer of Apple's design and their seamless web experiences, so I took it upon myself to build this clone to showcase my skills in front-end development, 3D rendering, and animations.

This project was a fantastic learning experience and a fun way to dive deep into creating a modern, interactive, and visually appealing website.

## ✨ Live Demo ✨

## 💡 What's Cool About It? 💡

*   **Mind-Blowing 3D Models:** Get up close and personal with the MacBook Pro! I used Three.js and `@react-three/fiber` to bring the 3D models to life right in your browser.
*   **Buttery Smooth Animations:** I'm a stickler for smooth animations, so I used GSAP to create a fluid and engaging user experience as you scroll through the page.
*   **Looks Great on Any Device:** Whether you're on your phone or a 4K monitor, the design is fully responsive and looks sharp on all screen sizes.
*   **Clean and Modular Code:** I built this with React, so the code is organized into reusable components, making it easy to read and maintain.
*   **Speedy Development:** Thanks to Vite, the development process was a breeze, with lightning-fast hot-reloading.

## 🛠️ My Tech Stack 🛠️

I carefully selected a stack of modern technologies to build this project:

*   **React:** The heart of the application, allowing me to build a component-based UI.
*   **Three.js & @react-three/fiber:** For the awesome 3D magic.
*   **GSAP:** My go-to for creating high-performance animations.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** For styling the UI with a utility-first approach, which I find super efficient.
*   **Vite:** For a next-generation front-end tooling experience.
*   **Zustand:** For lightweight and easy state management.
